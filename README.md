# Welcome to the Timeline!

## What the heck is this... "timeline"?

Well, glad you asked! It's an interactive... well, an interactive timeline of course! It is intended for sketching stories.

It has a beautifull main page where you can see and order your scenes (or events), relate characters and places to them, create conections between these characters and places, describe how they'll act and more!

## Okay, but i'm a developer, what do i do?

In that case you're here to contribute with the project!
We use Next.JS alongside Typescript for our project. Currently our TODO is as follows:

## TODO

-   Create timeline component
    -   Investigate if it can handle 2 or more events in each node.
-   Create a generic card component to showcase characters and places. This card should contain
    -   A title
    -   A description
    -   A place _(or a list of aparitions)_ in the timeline
    -   A tag to identifie the card as a character, a location or an event
    -   A list of related characters _(it can be empty)_
    -   A list of related places _(it can be empty)_
-   A card collection page
-   An auth flow
-   A DB setup
